    <!--Student Answer Section-->
    <!-- Directions for completing -->
    <p>Directions: Identify which type of programmer(Front End, Back end, Mobile Programmer or Data Analyst) would work on the features of Project Compass. Type your answers between the paragraph tags and be sure to provide an brief explanation for your choice.</p>

    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <p>1. Which programmer would build and manage the database for storing map pin locations in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 1 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back-End Programmer<p>
      <p>Back-End Programmers handle the creation of databases that can be used by the Front-End. In the video example it was creating a database for photos.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <p>2. Which programmer would make Project Compass responsive on different screen sizes on the web?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 2 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front-End Programmer<p>
      <p>Front-End Programmers handle how the experience for the user. Each user has a different screen size and it's the Front-End's job to display information appropiately. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <p>3. Which type of mobile programmer (Android or iOS) would be using Swift to turn Project Compass into a mobile app?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 3 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>iOS Mobile Programmer<p>
      <p>Apple developed swift as a language for it's devices. If swift becomes mainstream it may push out development for Android. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <p>4. Which programmer would add the image <img class="compass_icon"src="img/compass.svg"> to Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 4 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front-End Programmer<p>
      <p>Front-End Programmers handle the user experience and place objects on webpages as fashioned by the web designer. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <p>5. Who would evaluate information about Project Compass users to give insights for product decisions?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 5 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data Analyst<p>
      <p>Data Analysts make sense of data to help business officials make informed decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 6-->
    <p>6. Who would make requests to the Google Maps API in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 6 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back-End Programmer<p>
      <p>Back-End Programmers handle calls to the database. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <p>7. Which programmer would need to consider hardware components to make Project Compass usable with a microphone or camera?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 7 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back-End Programmer and Mobile Programmer<p>
      <p>Although microphones and cameras are not mobile-only, nearly all mobile users have easy access to a microphone and camera. Back-End Programmers would handle code
      in an application for desktops and laptops, whereas Mobile Programmers would handle code for phones. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 8 -->
    <p>8. Which programmer would make a post request endpoint to add comments onto Project compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 8 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back-End Programmer<p>

    <p>10. After evaluating these four different paths into programming, which role are you most interested in pursuing? Why?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 10 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data Analyst<p>
      <p>I have an extremely strong mathematics background and enjoy making sense of data. I love tackling a constant barrage of problems and puzzles.</p>
